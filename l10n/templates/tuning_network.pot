"The network subsystem is rather complex and its tuning highly depends on the "
"system use scenario and also on external factors such as software clients or "
"hardware components (switches, routers, or gateways) in your network. The "
"Linux kernel aims more at reliability and low latency than low overhead and "
"high throughput. Other settings can mean less security, but better "
