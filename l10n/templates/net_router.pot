"A router is a networking device that delivers and receives data (network "
"packets) to or from more than one network back and forth. You often use a "
"router to connect your local network to the remote network (Internet) or to "
"connect local network segments. With &sls; you can build a router with "
"features such as NAT (Network Address Translation) or advanced firewalling."
