"This manual discusses how to find the reasons for performance problems and "
"provides means to solve these problems. Before you start tuning your system, "
"you should make sure you have ruled out common problems and have found the "
"cause for the problem. You should also have a detailed plan on how to tune "
"the system, because applying random tuning tips often will not help and "
"could make things worse."
