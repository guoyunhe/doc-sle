"The implementation of an operating system either in an existing IT "

"the beginning of the planning process, you should try to define the project "
"goals and necessary features. This must always be done individually for each "
"project, but the questions to answer should include the following:"

"For optimal security and data safety, you should make regular updates of all "

"possibility of switching machines in the case of hardware failure."
