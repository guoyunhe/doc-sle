"The &aa; tools (&yast;, <command>aa-genprof</command> and <command>aa-"
"logprof</command>) support the use of a local repository. Whenever you start "
"to create a new profile from scratch, and there already is an inactive "
"profile in your local repository, you are asked whether you want to use the "
"existing inactive one from <filename>/etc/apparmor/profiles/extras</"
"filename> and whether you want to base your efforts on it. If you decide to "
"use this profile, it gets copied over to the directory of profiles enabled "
"by default (<filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename>) and loaded whenever &aa; "
"is started. Any further adjustments will be done to the active profile under "
"<filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename>."
