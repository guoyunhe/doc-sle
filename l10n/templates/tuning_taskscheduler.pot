"The Linux kernel controls the way that tasks (or processes) are managed on "
"the system. The task scheduler, sometimes called <emphasis>process "
"scheduler</emphasis>, is the part of the kernel that decides which task to "
"run next. It is responsible for best using system resources to guarantee "
"that multiple tasks are being executed simultaneously. This makes it a core "
"component of any multitasking operating system."
