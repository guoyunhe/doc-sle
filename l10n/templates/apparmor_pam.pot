"An &aa; profile applies to an executable program; if a portion of the "
"program needs different access permissions than other portions need, the "
"program can change hats via change_hat to a different role, also known as a "
"subprofile. The <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem> PAM module allows "
"applications to confine authenticated users into subprofiles based on group "
"names, user names, or a default profile. To accomplish this, "
"<systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem> needs to be registered as a PAM "
"session module."
