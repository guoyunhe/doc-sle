"&suse; extensively uses backports, for example for the migration of current "
"software fixes and features into released &sle; packages. The information in "
"this chapter helps you understand why it can be deceptive to compare version "
"numbers to judge the capabilities and the security of &sle; software "
"packages. You will understand how &suse; keeps the system software secure "
"and current while maintaining compatibility for your application software on "
"top of &sle; products. You will also learn how to check which public "
"security issues actually are addressed in your &sle; system software, and "
"how current your software really is."

"It is a general policy rule that no new upstream versions of a package are "
"introduced into our enterprise products. This rule is not an absolute rule "
"however. For a limited class of packages, in particular anti-virus software, "
"security concerns weigh heavier than the conservative approach that is "
"preferable from the perspective of quality assurance. For packages in that "
"class, occasionally newer versions are introduced into a released version of "
"an enterprise product line."

"Sometimes also for other types of packages the choice is made to introduce a "

"Because of the practice of backporting, one cannot simply compare version "
"numbers to determine whether a &suse; package contains a fix for a "
"particular issue or has had a particular feature added to it. With "
"backporting, the upstream part of a &suse; package's version number merely "
"indicates what upstream version the &suse; package is based on. It may "
"contain bug fixes and features that are not in the corresponding upstream "
"release, but that have been backported into the &suse; package."

"One particular area where this limited value of version numbers when "
"backporting is involved can cause problems is with security scanning tools. "
"Some security vulnerability scanning tools (or particular tests in such "
"tools) operate solely on version information. These tools/tests are thus "
"prone to generating <quote>false positives</quote> (claims that a vulnerable "
"piece of software has been found which in fact is not vulnerable) when "
"backports are involved. When evaluating reports from security scanning "
"tools, one should always investigate whether an entry is based on a version "
"number or on an actual test of whether an actual vulnerability exists."
