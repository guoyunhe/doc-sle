"Since the early &xen; 2.x releases, <command>xend</command> has been the de "
"facto toolstack for managing &xen; installations. In &xen; 4.1, a new "
"toolstack called libxenlight (also known as libxl) was introduced with "
"technology preview status. libxl is a small, low-level library written in C. "
"It has been designed to provide a simple API for all client toolstacks "
"(<link xlink:href=\"http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/XAPI\">XAPI</link>, &libvirt;, "
"xl). In &xen; 4.2, libxl was promoted to officially supported status and "
"<command>xend</command> was marked deprecated. <command>xend</command> has "
"been included in the &xen; 4.3 and 4.4 series to give users ample time to "
"convert their tooling to libxl, but it has been removed from the upstream "
"&xen; project and will no longer be provided starting with the &xen; 4.5 "
"series and &slsa; 12 SP1."

"Although &slsa; 11 SP3 contains &xen; 4.2, &suse; retained the "
"<command>xend</command> toolstack since making such an invasive change in a "
"service pack would be too disruptive for &sle; customers. However, &slsa; 12 "
"provides a suitable opportunity to move to the new libxl toolstack and "
"remove the deprecated, unmaintained <command>xend</command> stack. Starting "
"with &slsa; 12 SP1, <command>xend</command> is no longer supported."

"One of the major differences between <command>xend</command> and libxl is "
"that the former is stateful, while the latter is stateless. With "
"<command>xend</command>, all client applications such as <command>xm</"
"command> and &libvirt; see the same system state. <command>xend</command> is "
"responsible for maintaining state for the entire &xen; host. In libxl, "
"client applications such as <command>xl</command> or &libvirt; must maintain "
"state. Thus domains created with <command>xl</command> or not visible or "
"known to other libxl applications such as &libvirt;. Generally, it is "
"discouraged to mix and match libxl applications and is preferred that a "
"single libxl application be used to manage a &xen; host. In &sle; 12 , it is "
"recommended to use &libvirt; to manage &xen; hosts, allowing management of "
"the &xen; system through &libvirt; applications such as <command>virt-"
"manager</command>, <command>virt-install</command>, <command>virt-viewer</"
"command>, libguestfs, etc. If <command>xl</command> is used to manage the "
"&xen; host, any virtual machines under its management will not be accessible "
"to &libvirt;, and hence not accessible to any of the &libvirt; applications."

"The <command>xl</command> application, along with its configuration format "
"(see <command>man xl.cfg</command>), was designed to be backward-compatible "
"with the <command>xm</command> application and its configuration format (see "
"<command>man xm.cfg</command>). Existing <command>xm</command> configuration "
"should be usable with <command>xl</command>. Since libxl is stateless, and "
"<command>xl</command> does not support the notion of managed domains, &suse; "
"recommends using &libvirt; to manage &slsa; 12 &xen; hosts. SUSE has "
"provided a tool called <command>xen2libvirt</command>, which provides a "
"simple mechanism to import domains previously managed by <command>xend</"
"command> into &libvirt;. See <xref linkend=\"xen.xen2libvirt\"/> for more "
"information on <command>xen2libvirt</command>."
