"A Logical Volume Manager (LVM) logical volume snapshot is a copy-on-write "
"technology that monitors changes to an existing volume’s data blocks so that "
"when a write is made to one of the blocks, the block’s value at the snapshot "
"time is copied to a snapshot volume. In this way, a point-in-time copy of "
"the data is preserved until the snapshot volume is deleted."

"A file system snapshot contains metadata about itself and data blocks from a "

"you access data via the snapshot, you see a point-in-time copy of the source "
"logical volume. There is no need to restore data from backup media or to "

"LVM volume snapshots allow you to create a backup from a point-in-time view "
"of the file system. The snapshot is created instantly and persists until you "
"delete it. You can back up the file system from the snapshot while the "
"volume itself continues to be available for users. The snapshot initially "
"contains some metadata about the snapshot, but no actual data from the "
"source logical volume. Snapshot uses copy-on-write technology to detect when "
"data changes in an original data block. It copies the value it held when the "
"snapshot was taken to a block in the snapshot volume, then allows the new "
"data to be stored in the source block. As more blocks change from their "
"original value on the source logical volume, the snapshot size grows."

"When you are sizing the snapshot, consider how much data is expected to "
"change on the source logical volume and how long you plan to keep the "
"snapshot. The amount of space that you allocate for a snapshot volume can "
"vary, depending on the size of the source logical volume, how long you plan "
"to keep the snapshot, and the number of data blocks that are expected to "
"change during the snapshot’s lifetime. The snapshot volume cannot be resized "
"after it is created. As a guide, create a snapshot volume that is about 10% "
"of the size of the original logical volume. If you anticipate that every "
"block in the source logical volume will change at least one time before you "
"delete the snapshot, then the snapshot volume should be at least as large as "
"the source logical volume plus some additional space for metadata about the "
"snapshot volume. Less space is required if the data changes infrequently or "
"if the expected lifetime is sufficiently brief."

"In LVM2, snapshots are read/write by default. When you write data directly "

"snapshot volume. You can easily discard the changes by dismounting the "
