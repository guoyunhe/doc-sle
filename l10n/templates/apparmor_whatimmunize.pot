"Effective hardening of a computer system requires minimizing the number of "
"programs that mediate privilege, then securing the programs as much as "
"possible. With &aa;, you only need to profile the programs that are exposed "
"to attack in your environment, which drastically reduces the amount of work "
"required to harden your computer. &aa; profiles enforce policies to make "
"sure that programs do what they are supposed to do, but nothing else."
