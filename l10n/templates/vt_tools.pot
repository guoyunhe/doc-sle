"&libvirt; is a library that provides a common API for managing popular "
"virtualization solutions, among them &kvm;, &lxc;, and &xen;. The library "
"provides a normalized management API for these virtualization solutions, "
"allowing a stable, cross-hypervisor interface for higher-level management "
"tools. The library also provides APIs for management of virtual networks and "
"storage on the &vmhost;. The configuration of each &vmguest; is stored in an "

"With &libvirt; you can also manage your &vmguest;s remotely. It supports TLS "

"managing &vmhost;s centrally from a single workstation, alleviating the need "
