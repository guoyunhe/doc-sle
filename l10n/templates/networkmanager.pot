"Both <command>wicked</command> and NetworkManager can handle network "
"connections with a wireless network (with WEP, WPA-PSK, and WPA-Enterprise "
"access) and wired networks using DHCP and static configuration. They also "
"support connection through dial-up and VPN. With NetworkManager you can also "
"connect a mobile broadband (3G) modem or set up a DSL connection, which is "
"not possible with the traditional configuration."

"connect. To get the same functionality with <command>wicked</command>, more "
