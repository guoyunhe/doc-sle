"Each file and directory in a file system has three time stamps associated "

"<emphasis>modification time</emphasis>, and a time when the file metadata "
"was last modified called <emphasis>change time</emphasis>. Keeping access "
"time always uptodate has significant performance overhead since every read-"
"only access will incur a write operation. Thus by default every file system "
"updates access time only if current file access time is older than a day or "
"if it is older than file modification or change time. This feature is called "
"<emphasis>relative access time</emphasis> and the corresponding mount option "
"is <option>relatime</option>. Updates of access time can be completely "
"disabled using <option>noatime</option> mount option however you need to "
"verify your applications do not use it. This can be true for file and Web "
"servers or for network storage. If the default relative access time update "

"the page cache and are written back to persistent storage only later by an "
"independent kernel process. Thus the I/O priority setting generally does not "
