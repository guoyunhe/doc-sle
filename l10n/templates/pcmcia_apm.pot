"Power management is especially important on laptop computers, but is also "
"useful on other systems. ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) "
"is available on all modern computers (laptops, desktops, and servers). Power "
"management technologies require suitable hardware and BIOS routines. Most "
"laptops and many modern desktops and servers meet these requirements. It is "
"also possible to control CPU frequency scaling to save power or decrease "
