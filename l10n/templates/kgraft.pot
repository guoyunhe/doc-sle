"&kg; is a live patching technology for runtime patching of the Linux kernel, "
"without stopping the kernel. This maximizes system uptime, and thus system "
"availability, which is important for mission-critical systems. By allowing "
"dynamic patching of the kernel, the technology also encourages users to "
"install critical security updates without deferring them to a scheduled "
"downtime."

"A &kg; patch is a kernel module, intended for replacing whole functions in "

"Live kernel patching using &kg; is especially useful for quick response in "
"emergencies (when serious vulnerabilities are known and should be fixed when "
"possible or there are serious system stability issues with a known fix). It "

"Typical use cases for &kg; include systems like memory databases with huge "

"A &kg; patch is a <filename>.ko</filename> kernel module in a KMP RPM "

"To patch a kernel function, &kg; needs some space at the start of the "
"function to insert a jump to a new function. This space is allocated during "
"kernel compilation by GCC with function profiling turned on. In particular, "
"a 5-byte call instruction is injected to the start of kernel functions. When "
"such instrumented kernel is booting, profiling calls are replaced by 5-byte "
"NOP (no operation) instructions."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para

"After patching starts, the first byte is replaced by the INT3 (breakpoint) "
"instruction. This ensures atomicity of the 5-byte instruction replacement. "
"The other four bytes are replaced by the address to the new function. "

"Inter-processor non-maskable interrupts (IPI NMI) are used throughout the "
"process to flush speculative decoding queues of other CPUs in the system. "
"This allows switching to the new function without ever stopping the kernel, "
"not even for a very short moment. The interruptions by IPI NMIs can be "
"measured in microseconds and are not considered service interruptions as "
"they happen while the kernel is running in any case."

"Callers are never patched. Instead, the callee's NOPs are replaced by a JMP "
"to the new function. JMP instructions remain forever. This takes care of "
"function pointers, including in structures, and does not require saving any "
"old data for the possibility of un-patching."

"However, these steps alone would not be good enough: since the functions "
"would be replaced non-atomically, a new fixed function in one part of the "
"kernel could still be calling an old function elsewhere or vice versa. If "
"the semantics of the function interfaces changed in the patch, chaos would "
"ensue."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para

"Thus, until all functions are replaced, &kg; uses an approach based on "
"trampolines and similar to RCU (read-copy-update), to ensure a consistent "
"view of the world to each user space thread, kernel thread and kernel "
"interrupt. A per-thread flag is set on each kernel entry and exit. This way, "
"an old function would always call another old function and a new function "
"always a new one. Once all processes have the \"new universe\" flag set, "
"patching is complete, trampolines can be removed and the code can operate at "
"full speed without performance impact other than an extra-long jump for each "
"patched function."
