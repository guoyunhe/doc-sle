"The primary component of the operating system that enables virtualization is "
"a Hypervisor (or virtual machine manager), which is a layer of software that "
"runs directly on server hardware. It controls platform resources, sharing "
"them among multiple &vmguest;s and their operating systems by presenting "
"virtualized hardware interfaces to each &vmguest;."

"&sle; is an enterprise-class Linux server operating system that offers two "
"types of Hypervisors: &xen; and &kvm;. Both Hypervisors support "

"paravirtualized mode. &sle; with &xen; or &kvm; acts as a virtualization "
