"After turning on the computer, the BIOS or the UEFI initializes the screen "
"and keyboard, and tests the main memory. Up to this stage, the machine does "
"not access any mass storage media. Subsequently, the information about the "
"current date, time, and the most important peripherals are loaded from the "
"CMOS values. When the first hard disk and its geometry are recognized, the "
"system control passes from the BIOS to the boot loader. If the BIOS supports "
"network booting, it is also possible to configure a boot server that "
"provides the boot loader. On &amd64;/&intel64; systems, PXE boot is needed. "
"Other architectures commonly use the BOOTP protocol to get the boot loader."

"The first physical 512-byte data sector of the first hard disk is loaded "

"boot loader determine the remaining part of the boot process. Therefore, the "
"first 512&nbsp;bytes on the first hard disk are called the <emphasis>Master "
"Boot Record</emphasis> (MBR). The boot loader then passes control to the "
"actual operating system, in this case, the Linux Kernel. More information "
"about &grub;, the Linux boot loader, can be found in <xref linkend=\"cha."
"grub2\"/>. For a network boot, the BIOS acts as the boot loader. It gets the "
"boot image from the boot server and starts the system. This is completely "
