"Sophisticated system configurations require specific disk setups. All common "
"partitioning tasks can be done with &yast;. To get persistent device naming "
"with block devices, use the block devices below <filename>/dev/disk/by-id</"
"filename> or <filename>/dev/disk/by-uuid</filename>. Logical Volume "
"Management (LVM) is a disk partitioning scheme that is designed to be much "
"more flexible than the physical partitioning used in standard setups. Its "
"snapshot functionality enables easy creation of data backups. Redundant "
"Array of Independent Disks (RAID) offers increased data integrity, "
"performance, and fault tolerance. &productname; also supports multipath I/O "
