"The NTP (network time protocol) mechanism is a protocol for synchronizing "
"the system time over the network. First, a machine can obtain the time from "
"a server that is a reliable time source. Second, a machine can itself act as "
"a time source for other computers in the network. The goal is twofold&mdash;"
"maintaining the absolute time and synchronizing the system time of all "
"machines within a network."

"Maintaining an exact system time is important in many situations. The built-"
"in hardware clock does often not meet the requirements of applications such "
"as databases or clusters. Manual correction of the system time would lead to "
"severe problems because, for example, a backward leap can cause malfunction "
"of critical applications. Within a network, it is usually necessary to "
"synchronize the system time of all machines, but manual time adjustment is a "
"bad approach. NTP provides a mechanism to solve these problems. The NTP "
"service continuously adjusts the system time with reliable time servers in "
"the network. It further enables the management of local reference clocks, "
"such as radio-controlled clocks."
