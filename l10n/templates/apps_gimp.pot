"GIMP (<emphasis>the GNU Image Manipulation Program</emphasis>) is a program "
"for creating and editing raster graphics. In most aspects, its features are "
"comparable to those of Adobe&ast; Photoshop&ast; and other commercial "
"programs. Use it to resize and retouch photographs, design graphics for Web "
"pages, create covers for your custom CDs, or almost any other graphics "
"project. It meets the needs of both amateurs and professionals."
