"One of the main characteristics of a Linux or Unix system is its ability to "
"handle several users at the same time (multiuser) and to allow these users "
"to perform several tasks (multitasking) on the same computer simultaneously. "

"On a Linux system, passwords are not stored as plain text and the entered "

"In the seventies, it was argued that this method would be more secure than "
"others because of the relative slowness of the algorithm used which took a "
"few seconds to encrypt one password. In the meantime, however, PCs have "
"become powerful enough to do several hundred thousand or even millions of "
"encryptions per second. Because of this, encrypted passwords should not be "
"visible to regular users (<filename>/etc/shadow</filename> cannot be read by "
"normal users). It is even more important that passwords are not easy to "
"guess, in case the password file becomes visible because of an error. "

"Configure your system so it cannot be booted from a removable device, either "

"In general, any remote attack performed by an attacker who puts himself "
"between the communicating hosts is called a <emphasis>man-in-the-middle "
"attack</emphasis>. What almost all types of man-in-the-middle attacks have "
"in common is that the victim is usually not aware that there is something "
"happening. There are many variants. For example, the attacker could pick up "
"a connection request and forward that to the target machine. Now the victim "
"has unwittingly established a connection with the wrong host, because the "
"other end is posing as the legitimate destination machine."

"The simplest form of a man-in-the-middle attack is called <emphasis>sniffer</"
"emphasis> (the attacker is <quote>only</quote> listening to the network "
"traffic passing by). As a more complex attack, the <quote>man in the middle</"
"quote> could try to take over an already established connection (hijacking). "
"To do so, the attacker would need to analyze the packets for some time to be "
"able to predict the TCP sequence numbers belonging to the connection. When "
"the attacker finally seizes the role of the target host, the victims notice "
"this, because they get an error message saying the connection was terminated "
"because of a failure. That there are protocols not secured against hijacking "
"through encryption (which only perform a simple authentication procedure "
"upon establishing the connection) makes it easier for attackers."

"DNS poisoning means that the attacker corrupts the cache of a DNS server by "
"replying to it with spoofed DNS reply packets, trying to get the server to "
"send certain data to a victim who is requesting information from that "
"server. Many servers maintain a trust relationship with other hosts, based "
"on IP addresses or host names. The attacker needs a good understanding of "
"the actual structure of the trust relationships among hosts to disguise "
"itself as one of the trusted hosts. Usually, the attacker analyzes some "
"packets received from the server to get the necessary information. The "
"attacker often needs to target a well-timed DoS attack at the name server as "
"well. Protect yourself by using encrypted connections that can verify the "
"identity of the hosts to which to connect."
