"In networked environments, it is often necessary to access hosts from a "
"remote location. If a user sends login and password strings for "
"authentication purposes as plain text, they could be intercepted and misused "
"to gain access to that user account without the authorized user knowing "
"about it. This would open all the user's files to an attacker and the "
"illegal account could be used to obtain administrator or <systemitem class="
"\"username\">root</systemitem> access, or to penetrate other systems. In the "
"past, remote connections were established with <command>telnet</command>, "
"<command>rsh</command> or <command>rlogin</command>, which offered no guards "
"against eavesdropping in the form of encryption or other security "
"mechanisms. There are other unprotected communication channels, like the "
"traditional FTP protocol and some remote copying programs like <command>rcp</"

"The SSH suite provides the necessary protection by encrypting the "
"authentication strings (usually a login name and a password) and all the "
"other data exchanged between the hosts. With SSH, the data flow could still "
"be recorded by a third party, but the contents are encrypted and cannot be "
"reverted to plain text unless the encryption key is known. So SSH enables "
"secure communication over insecure networks, such as the Internet. The SSH "
