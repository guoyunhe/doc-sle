"There is no single standard for Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Linux beyond "
"the simple read, write, and execute (<literal>rwx</literal>) flags for user, "
"group, and others (<literal>ugo</literal>). One option for finer control is "
"the <citetitle>Draft POSIX ACLs</citetitle>, which were never formally "
"standardized by POSIX. Another is the NFSv4 ACLs, which were designed to be "
"part of the NFSv4 network file system with the goal of making something that "
"provided reasonable compatibility between POSIX systems on Linux and WIN32 "
"systems on Microsoft Windows."

"NFSv4 ACLs are not sufficient to correctly implement Draft POSIX ACLs so no "
"attempt has been made to map ACL accesses on an NFSv4 client (such as using "

"When using NFSv4, Draft POSIX ACLs cannot be used even in emulation and "
"NFSv4 ACLs need to be used directly; that means while <command>setfacl</"
"command> can work on NFSv3, it cannot work on NFSv4. To allow NFSv4 ACLs to "
"be used on an NFSv4 file system, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server provides the "
"<filename>nfs4-acl-tools</filename> package, which contains the following:"

"These operate in a generally similar way to <command>getfacl</command> and "
"<command>setfacl</command> for examining and modifying NFSv4 ACLs. These "
"commands are effective only if the file system on the NFS server provides "
"full support for NFSv4 ACLs. Any limitation imposed by the server will "
"affect programs running on the client in that some particular combinations "
"of Access Control Entries (ACEs) might not be possible."
