"Masquerading is the Linux-specific form of NAT (network address translation) "
"and can be used to connect a small LAN with the Internet. LAN hosts use IP "
"addresses from the private range (see <xref linkend=\"sec.basicnet.addresses."
"route\"/>) and on the Internet official IP addresses are used. To be able to "
"connect to the Internet, a LAN host's private address is translated to an "
"official one. This is done on the router, which acts as the gateway between "
"the LAN and the Internet. The underlying principle is a simple one: The "
"router has more than one network interface, typically a network card and a "
"separate interface connecting with the Internet. While the latter links the "
"router with the outside world, one or several others link it with the LAN "
"hosts. With these hosts in the local network connected to the network card "
"(such as <literal>eth0</literal>) of the router, they can send any packets "

"The target host of the connection can see your router, but knows nothing "

"<emphasis>Firewall</emphasis> is probably the term most widely used to "
"describe a mechanism that provides and manages a link between networks while "
"also controlling the data flow between them. Strictly speaking, the "
"mechanism described in this section is called a <emphasis>packet filter</"
"emphasis>. A packet filter regulates the data flow according to certain "
"criteria, such as protocols, ports, and IP addresses. This allows you to "
"block packets that, according to their addresses, are not supposed to reach "
"your network. To allow public access to your Web server, for example, "
"explicitly open the corresponding port. However, a packet filter does not "
"scan the contents of packets with legitimate addresses, such as those "
"directed to your Web server. For example, if incoming packets were intended "
"to compromise a CGI program on your Web server, the packet filter would "
"still let them through."

"A more effective but more complex mechanism is the combination of several "
"types of systems, such as a packet filter interacting with an application "
"gateway or proxy. In this case, the packet filter rejects any packets "
"destined for disabled ports. Only packets directed to the application "
"gateway are accepted. This gateway or proxy pretends to be the actual client "
"of the server. In a sense, such a proxy could be considered a masquerading "
"host on the protocol level used by the application. One example for such a "
"proxy is Squid, an HTTP and FTP proxy server. To use Squid, the browser must "
"be configured to communicate via the proxy. Any HTTP pages or FTP files "
"requested are served from the proxy cache and objects not found in the cache "
"are fetched from the Internet by the proxy."
