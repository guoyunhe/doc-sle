"Power management aims at reducing operating costs for energy and cooling "
"systems while at the same time keeping the performance of a system at a "
"level that matches the current requirements. Thus, power management is "
"always a matter of balancing the actual performance needs and power saving "
"options for a system. Power management can be implemented and used at "
"different levels of the system. A set of specifications for power management "
"functions of devices and the operating system interface to them has been "
"defined in the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI). As power "
"savings in server environments can primarily be achieved at the processor "
"level, this chapter introduces some main concepts and highlights some tools "
"for analyzing and influencing relevant parameters."

"At the CPU level, you can control power usage in various ways. For example "
"by using idling power states (C-states), changing CPU frequency (P-states), "
"and throttling the CPU (T-states). The following sections give a short "
"introduction to each approach and its significance for power savings. "

"When a processor is in the <literal>C0</literal> state, it is executing "

"downside is that they introduce latency. This means, it takes more time for "
"the CPU to go back to <literal>C0</literal>. Depending on workload (threads "
"waking up, triggering CPU usage and then going back to sleep again for a "
"short period of time) and hardware (for example, interrupt activity of a "
