"A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number for a file system "
"that is unique on both the local system and across other systems. It is "
"randomly generated with system hardware information and time stamps as part "
"of its seed. UUIDs are commonly used to uniquely tag devices."

"Using non-persistent <quote>traditional</quote> device names such as "
"<filename>/dev/sda1</filename> may render the system unbootable when adding "
"storage. For example, if root (<filename>/</filename>) is assigned to "
"<filename>/dev/sda1</filename>, it might be reassigned to <filename>/dev/"
"sdg1</filename> after a SAN has been attached or additional hard disks have "
"been applied to the system. In this case the boot loader configuration and "
"the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file need to be adjusted, otherwise the "
"system will no longer boot."

"One way to avoid this problem is to use the UUID in the boot loader and "
"<filename>/etc/fstab</filename> files for the boot device. This is the "
"default in &sle; since version 12. The UUID is a property of the file system "
"and can change if you reformat the drive. Other alternatives to using UUIDs "
"of device names would be to identify devices by ID or label."
