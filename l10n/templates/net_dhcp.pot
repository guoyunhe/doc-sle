"The purpose of the <emphasis>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</emphasis> "
"(DHCP) is to assign network settings centrally (from a server) rather than "
"configuring them locally on every workstation. A host configured to use DHCP "
"does not have control over its own static address. It is enabled to "
"configure itself completely and automatically according to directions from "
"the server. If you use the &nm; on the client side, you do not need to "
"configure the client. This is useful if you have changing environments and "
"only one interface active at a time. Never use &nm; on a machine that runs a "
"DHCP server."

"One way to configure a DHCP server is to identify each client using the "
"hardware address of its network card (which should be fixed in most cases), "
"then supply that client with identical settings each time it connects to the "
"server. DHCP can also be configured to assign addresses to each relevant "
"client dynamically from an address pool set up for this purpose. In the "
"latter case, the DHCP server tries to assign the same address to the client "
"each time it receives a request, even over extended periods. This works only "
"if the network does not have more clients than addresses."

"DHCP makes life easier for system administrators. Any changes, even bigger "
"ones, related to addresses and the network configuration in general can be "
"implemented centrally by editing the server's configuration file. This is "
"much more convenient than reconfiguring numerous workstations. It is also "
"much easier to integrate machines, particularly new machines, into the "
"network, because they can be given an IP address from the pool. Retrieving "
"the appropriate network settings from a DHCP server is especially useful in "
"case of laptops regularly used in different networks."
