"Data synchronization is no problem for computers that are permanently linked "
"by means of a fast network. In this case, use a network file system, like "
"NFS, and store the files on a server, enabling all hosts to access the same "
"data via the network. This approach is impossible if the network connection "
"is poor or not permanent. When you are on the road with a laptop, copies of "
"all needed files must be on the local hard disk. However, it is then "
"necessary to synchronize modified files. When you modify a file on one "
"computer, make sure a copy of the file is updated on all other computers. "
"For occasional copies, this can be done manually with scp or rsync. However, "
"if many files are involved, the procedure can be complicated and requires "
"great care to avoid errors, such as overwriting a new file with an old file."
