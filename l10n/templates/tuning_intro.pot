"&productname; is used for a broad range of usage scenarios in enterprise and "
"scientific data centers. &suse; has ensured &productname; is set up in a way "
"that it accommodates different operation purposes with optimal performance. "
"However, &productname; must meet very different demands when employed on a "
"number crunching server compared to a file server, for example."

"It is not possible to ship a distribution that is optimized for all "
"workloads. Different workloads vary substantially in some aspects. Most "
"important among those are I/O access patterns, memory access patterns, and "
"process scheduling. A behavior that perfectly suits a certain workload might "
"reduce performance of another workload. For example, I/O-intensive tasks, "
"such as handling database requests, usually have completely different "
"requirements than CPU-intensive tasks, such as video encoding. The "
"versatility of Linux makes it possible to configure your system in a way "
"that it brings out the best in each usage scenario."

"This manual introduces you to means to monitor and analyze your system. It "
"describes methods to manage system resources and to tune your system. This "
"guide does <emphasis>not</emphasis> offer recipes for special scenarios, "
"because each server has got its own different demands. It rather enables you "
"to thoroughly analyze your servers and make the most out of them."

"The Linux kernel can be optimized either by using sysctl, via the <filename>/"
"proc</filename> and <filename>/sys</filename> file systems or by kernel "
"command line parameter. This part covers tuning the I/O performance and "
"optimizing the way how Linux schedules processes. It also describes basic "
"principles of memory management and shows how memory management could be "
"fine-tuned to suit needs of specific applications and usage patterns. "
"Furthermore, it describes how to optimize network performance."
