"Many security vulnerabilities result from bugs in <emphasis>trusted</"
"emphasis> programs. A trusted program runs with privileges that attackers "
"want to possess. The program fails to keep that trust if there is a bug in "
"the program that allows the attacker to acquire said privilege."

"&aareg; is an application security solution designed specifically to apply "
"privilege confinement to suspect programs. &aa; allows the administrator to "
"specify the domain of activities the program can perform by developing a "
"security <emphasis>profile</emphasis>. A security profile is a listing of "
"files that the program may access and the operations the program may "
"perform. &aa; secures applications by enforcing good application behavior "
"without relying on attack signatures, so it can prevent attacks even if "
"previously unknown vulnerabilities are being exploited."
