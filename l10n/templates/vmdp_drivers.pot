"Virtualization allows the consolidation of workloads on newer, more "
"powerful, energy-efficient hardware. Paravirtualized operating systems such "
"as &productnamereg; and other Linux distributions are aware of the "
"underlying virtualization platform, and can therefore interact efficiently "
"with it. Unmodified operating systems such as Microsoft Windows* are unaware "
"of the virtualization platform and expect to interact directly with the "
"hardware. Because this is not possible when consolidating servers, the "
"hardware must be emulated for the operating system. Emulation can be slow, "
"but it is especially troubling for high-throughput disk and network "
"subsystems. Most performance loss occurs in this area."

"The &sle; Virtual Machine Driver Pack (VMDP) contains 32-bit and 64-bit "
"paravirtualized network, bus and block drivers for several Microsoft Windows "
"operating systems. These drivers bring many of the performance advantages of "
"paravirtualized operating systems to unmodified operating systems because "
"only the paravirtualized device driver (not the rest of the operating "
"system) is aware of the virtualization platform. For example, a "
"paravirtualized disk device driver appears as a normal, physical disk to the "
"operating system. However, the device driver interacts directly with the "
"virtualization platform (with no emulation) to efficiently deliver disk "
"access, allowing the disk and network subsystems to operate at near native "
"speeds in a virtualized environment, without requiring changes to existing "
"operating systems."
